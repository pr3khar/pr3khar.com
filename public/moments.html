          Openhouse is a holistic after-school learning space for children aged
          4 to 15 years with classes on academic and extra curricular topics of

        <div class="section-text">
          There was a sizeable gap in communication when it comes to discussing
          what children learn and experience at Openhouse and the information
          that is communicated to parents. While Openhouse tries it's best to
          provide a comprehensive education and learning experience to their
          students, parents may not always have a clear understanding of what
          their children are learning, how they are progressing, and what
          challenges they may be facing, which also leads to drop-offs after a
          few classes.

        <div class="section-text">
          Moments, as the word means, is all about sharing the in-class moments
          of the children with their parents. It is designed to bridge the gap
          between what students do at Openhouse and the information communicated
          with parents. It will make parents feel more connected and excited as
          they see their children do and learn exciting things at Openhouse. We
          primarily aim to start with in-class pictures and videos , but down
          the line, aim to add other forms like text, stickers, milestones, etc.

          Popular social media applications: Instagram, Facebook & LinkedIn

        <div class="section-text">
          All our users have used popular social media applications like
          Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and others. Hence, they are somewhat
          already accustomed to the kind of interactions they offer and the flow
          of information. <br /><br />So, we took inspiration from the kind of
          interactions and information architecture these popular platforms
          offer and scaled them as per our needs and requirements.

        <div class="section-head">
          A smooth and simple experience from clicking a moment to uploading and
          sharing it
        </div>
        <div class="section-text">
          The entire flow from clicking a moment to uploading it needs to be
          simple and smooth as teachers are expected to upload them within the
          class hours and for multiple children. On average, there are about
          <bold>8 children per class</bold>, so it was quite essential to make
          it smooth and simple, so it doesn't disrupt the flow of the class.<br /><br />So,
          we started with listing out the essential components that need to be
          considered or be acted upon while uploading that specific moment and
          that sort them based on priority and probability of usage.

          Clicking/shooting a moment
        </div>
        <div class="section-text">
          This was fairly straightforward, there are two possible ways for the
          teacher to click/shoot a moment, one is through the openhouse app and
          the other is through the native camera app and then upload it (useful
          when teacher uploads it post the class). One element was to design for
          the case when there multiple media files for a single moment while
          clicking them through the openhouse app.

          Should we ask for captions?
        </div>
        <div class="section-text">
          We conducted a small study internally to see if there's any noticeable
          preference towards having captions. The result was very much in favour
          of having captions. So, the next question was to figure out how to go
          about it. There were two options: Making teachers write them for each
          moment personally or make them choose from a pre-defined list.
        </div>

          />
        </div>
        <div class="section-text">
          We were concerned about the quality of the text written by the teacher
          accompanying the photo/video as uploading moments transforms into a
          daily activity. On average, there are about 8 children in a class, so
          a teacher is expected to share around 7-8 moments per class. Hence, it
          is only natural that with time, the quality might degrade.
          <br /><br />
          But the problem with choosing from a pre-defined list was that it
          would defeat one of the core goals of moments by removing the layer of
          personal touch.
          <br /><br />
          So, we decided to not go with it and analyse the user behaviour and in
          case we feel there is a need, introduce it then.

        <div class="section-text">
          We recognized the potential drawbacks of promoting unnecessary
          competition driven by likes and reactions. Consequently, we've made
          the decision that each moment will be shared exclusively with the
          respective parents. This choice aims to prioritize a focused,
          growth-oriented atmosphere where every child's progress is celebrated
          without the distractions of social validation metrics.
          <br /><br />
          In case of teachers, we thought that sharing moments with all the
          teachers of the same category (like a moment of a child painting would
          be shown to all the art teachers) might act as motivation to keep at
          it because it might become a tedious task after a while.

          We explored a lot of reactions with multiple variations, one with just
          likes, one with multiple reactions like "lovely", "amazing", "wow!",
          etc.
          <br /><br />
          In the end settled on a gradual rollout method, where we decided to
          start with just a like reaction, and then introduce comments and
          reactions. Eventually, we thought the number of reactions to be a
          ticking number that could also excite the teachers to keep at it.

          hence, we thought of introducing a personal webpage for each moment,
          which would be generated when parents want to share their child's
          moment with someone not a part of the openhouse family â that way it
          not becomes a tool for parents to share what they are doing but also a
          hook for others to see what children learn and do at openhouse,
          potentially, enticing them to join the family.

          Moments is introduced to bridge the gap between classroom learning and

          we also plan to add text insights, stickers and other things that sort
          of build a timeline for their child and their growth as they take part
          in multiple activities and courses that openhouse offers.
          <br /><br />Once the parents see a moment for the day, we aim to it so
          that they feel satisfied and content with the choice they have made
          and excited for what lies ahead.
