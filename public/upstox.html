          I interned with the product design team from April, 2022 till August,
          2022. I worked on multiple projects with varied scopes and timelines
          while collaborating with the product and engineering teams.

          Starting my internship at Upstox was a nerve-wracking experience.
          Being new to the industry, all the trading lingo was alien to me, and
          it was essential for me to get the hang of them, to be able to design
          as per the trader and investor needs and perspectives ‚Äî plus, it was
          my first time working in a team this size, and working with the design
          system and massive number of files felt overwhelming at start.
          Fortunately, my teammates were incredibly supportive and patient with
          me. They took the time to explain the concepts and terminologies until
          I felt comfortable with them.
          <br /><br />
          As time went by, I started to enjoy my work more and more. I really
          appreciated the camaraderie and team spirit. The Friday evening game
          calls were a fun way to unwind after a long week, and I felt like I
          was a part of a team. My colleagues were always willing to help and
          collaborate on projects, and I learned a lot from them. During my
          internship, I worked on a variety of projects that taught me a variety
          of stuff. I had the opportunity to work with quite a few people, which
          I felt was very integral to my learning, as everyone has their set of
          tricks, whether it be the specific plugins or the way they approach a
          problem, or even they document their thought process, it was truly a
          very nice experience getting to learn from some of the most talented
          people in the industry. Though it was not all rainbows and
          butterflies, there were some weeks where I felt like ‚Äúoh, shit! Where
          have I come.‚Äù Hand offs with the engineering teams, presenting my
          designs in the review meeting, they were all unique experiences that
          felt daunting at first but I cherish them in retrospect.
          <br /><br />
          Looking back, my time at Upstox was an amazing experience, and I would
          recommend the company to anyone looking for a challenging and
          rewarding work environment.
