          Rovers is designed as a utility app that can help track, manage and
          plan your expenses and outings, whether group or solo.
          <br /><br />
          Being a student myself, I find managing my expenses and outings to be
          a vital aspect of my daily life. I often found myself switching
          between various applications to keep a check on my expenditure and
          track my plans. This led to Rovers.

              it. Even while using bill-splitting applications, they tend to not

            As the approach taken by many companies, offering some sort of

            experience. Users can be provided with rover coin whenever they
            settle their due in time or keep up with their budget, or upload

              As users collect rover coins, they can spend them on the products

              appreciated and rewarded.
