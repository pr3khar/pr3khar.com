            I interned with the product design team from April, 2022 till
            August, 2022. I worked on multiple projects with varied scopes and
            timelines while collaborating with the product and engineering
            teams.

            Starting my internship at Upstox was a nerve-wracking experience.
            Being new to the industry, all the trading lingo was alien to me,
            and it was essential for me to get the hang of them, to be able to
            design as per the trader and investor needs and perspectives — plus,
            it was my first time working in a team this size, and working with
            the design system and massive number of files felt overwhelming at
            start. Fortunately, my teammates were incredibly supportive and
            patient with me. They took the time to explain the concepts and
            terminologies until I felt comfortable with them.
            <br /><br />
            As time went by, I started to enjoy my work more and more. I really
            appreciated the camaraderie and team spirit. The Friday evening game
            calls were a fun way to unwind after a long week, and I felt like I
            was a part of a team. My colleagues were always willing to help and
            collaborate on projects, and I learned a lot from them. During my
            internship, I worked on a variety of projects that taught me a
            variety of stuff. I had the opportunity to work with quite a few
            people, which I felt was very integral to my learning, as everyone
            has their set of tricks, whether it be the specific plugins or the
            way they approach a problem, or even they document their thought
            process, it was truly a very nice experience getting to learn from
            some of the most talented people in the industry. Though it was not
            all rainbows and butterflies, there were some weeks where I felt
            like “oh, shit! Where have I come.” Hand offs with the engineering
            teams, presenting my designs in the review meeting, they were all
            unique experiences that felt daunting at first but I cherish them in
            retrospect.
            <br /><br />
            Looking back, my time at Upstox was an amazing experience, and I
            would recommend the company to anyone looking for a challenging and
            rewarding work environment.
